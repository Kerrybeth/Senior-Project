**CalendarBoard** is a lightweight, personal planner that allows users to manage their own schedule, compare schedules with other users, and manage privacy settings. Users can also create organizations/groups, schedule meetings within it, and manage the privacy and permissions of it. The app is meant to be a rich environment for specific people - say students, faculty, gamers, friends, and more to quickly see what's going on and get connected. You can come here to see whatever group or organization you're part of is up to and get resources on the spot. 

## ‚û°Ô∏èTimeline + Context 

This is our senior project and we will spend our entire senior year making it come to life. The first semester of our 2023 year was used for designing and the second for implementation. We meet twice a week as a group and spend as much time as possible outside working on this. Our goal is to have a complete working version per our design before May 14th, 2023 (our graduation date) and go from there. There might be some interest to keep this up and working after that but this depends on the traction the project picks up once live and available to the public. 

## ‚û°Ô∏èLatest Demo

Here is a quick sneak peak of our on-going `dev` branch. Although the web app is optimized for desktop we are making efforts to make it as mobile friendly as possible.

## ‚û°Ô∏èRunning the project

You will need to get a copy of the repo (either downloading it or cloning) and you will need Node.js and NPM. Once you have all of those then you can simply open the project in your editor of choice, and run it(with `npm start`)! 

## ‚û°Ô∏èDesign / Wireframes
